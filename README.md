# TURNBULL: Stata module to estimate the Turnbull empirical distribution estimator of willingness to pay

## Description

    turnbull estimates the Turnbull empirical distribution estimator of willingness to pay
    proposed by Carson et al (1994a,b). Haab and McConnell (1997) argue that this estimator solves
    the problem of estimating negative willingness to pay without resorting to ad hoc distribution
    assumptions, and show that central tendency measures of willingness to pay from parametric
    models are sensitive to the assumed distribution, while the lower bound Turnbull estimate is
    robust accross distributions.
